CIS580/Othello

Rules of Play
Othello is a two player alternating turn based game
A turn consists of placing down a colored tile
Players are differentiated by the color tile they place
	in this simulation the user is 'Black' and the computer is 'White'
A tile must be placed so that tiles of the opposing color are sandwhiched between tiles of the players color
	then sandwiched tiles are now 'flipped' and become the color of the sandwhiching tiles
For ease of play squares which the user can play in are highlighted on the users turn.

Win Condition
The game is over when all the spaces on the board have been filled
The winner is whoever has more tiles on the board

Starting the game
The game starts with a board that has two of each color tile in the middle four squares of the board
	such that tiles of the same color are diagonal from eachother
'Black', in this case the user, plays first.
